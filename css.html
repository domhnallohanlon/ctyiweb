            <h4>CSS</h4>
          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. As you will quickly learn, the most effective way of 
          styling the content on your website is with CSS, because it allows you to seperate the content 
          from the presentation. To see some incredible examples of this in action visit

          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          Since CSS is a different language from CSS the syntax, or structure, of the language is different from 
          HTML. First of all you have to select what element on the page you want to style. This is known as a 
          <em>selector</em>. For example you might want to change the appearance of a `<div>`. Once you've 
          chosen what thing to style you have to specify what <em>property</em> you want to modify. Finally you 
          need to give the chosen property a <em>value.</em> Read on to find out more about this important langauge.
