### Download and Instllation
Sublime is available to download for a variety of operating systems [here.][sublime2]

### Package Manager
Like many of the best text editors, one of the best features of Sublime Text 2 is its extensibility - its ability to have more functionality added to it as and when it's needed. There are a wide variety of packages that can be added to Sublime that handle everything from building software, generating useful code snippets or even just changing the appearance of Sublime itself.
Strangely, the default method for adding packages is less the elegant so the first package you should install after a fresh install is Package Control by Will Bond. Get the approproate versrions from [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
To open a new file type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> <br>

To open the Command Palette type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> This brings up a drop-down where you can simply type in what you want to do. For example, if you type *HTML* you will see that the options are refined and you can choose *Set Syntax: HTML*

To select multiple lines type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>&darr;</kbd>
