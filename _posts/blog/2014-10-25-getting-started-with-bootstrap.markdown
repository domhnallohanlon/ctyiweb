## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a collection of HTML, CSS and JS code, designed and developed by Twitter to make creating responsive, mobile-first web sites as pain free as possible. Everything you need to get started is available from their [website][getbootstrap]

## What's in the box?
Once you've downloaded Boostrap you're ready to get started using your favourite text editor. To give your site the Bootstrap look and feel you'll need to include the .css file in the `<head>` of your document nad link to the bootstrap and jQuery javascript libraries at the very end of your page, just above the `</body>` tag.
