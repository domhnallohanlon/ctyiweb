## Objectives
Users will need to find their way around your website, here are a few ways to help them out.

### Preview
Here's what the completed project will look like.


### The HTML
We'll start by creating a basic framework for the site so all of our pages have a similar look and feel

### The CSS
Once we know where all the content will go we can make it look better by styling it with CSS.
