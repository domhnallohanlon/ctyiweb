## Objectives
Grid Systems are everywhere - develop a better understanding of how they work by creating your own

### Preview
Here's what the completed project will look like.


### The HTML
We'll start by creating a basic framework for the site so all of our pages have a similar look and feel

### The CSS
Once we know where all the content will go we can make it look better by styling it with CSS.
