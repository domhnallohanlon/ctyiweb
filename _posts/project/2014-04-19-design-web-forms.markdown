## Objectives
All across the web, from log-in forms to search boxes to registration forms, there are lots of times when you need your site to accept input from the visitor. This project takes you through the HTML you need to create form elements and looks at some of the best practices to employ when building your own.

### Preview
Here's what the completed project will look like.


### The HTML
We'll start by creating a basic framework for the site so all of our pages have a similar look and feel

### The CSS
Once we know where all the content will go we can make it look better by styling it with CSS.
