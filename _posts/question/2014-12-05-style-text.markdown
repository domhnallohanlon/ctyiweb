### Overview

Previously we've seen how to display blocks of text on a page, and how to choose the font for those blocks of text. The last thing we want to do is style individual words or sentences on the page. This might be an aesthetic decision, like using drop caps or small caps at the beginning of a new paragraph. Alternatively, it could be to add emphasis to particular words or sentences by using bold, italic or underlined text. Certain pieces of text can also be styled to reflect the fact that updates or changes have been made to the page by using the strikethrough tag.
