### Overview

Often when you are designing a page or app you will need to group several elements together, for example a menu at the top or side of the page, or perhaps a selection of thhumbnails if you are making an image gallery app.
In cases such as this the `<div>` tag is your friend

#### <DIV>

The div tag is a sub-division (div-ision?) of a page where other elements can easily be grouped together. Just like most tags a div begins with an opening tag `<div>` and ends with a closing tag `</div>`.
