#### Tim Berners Lee
In the 1980s, Berners Lee was a researcher working at CERN (of Large Hadron Collider fame) where he developed a markup langauge and browser for use internally to help organise and retreive information and reasearch accross the organisation. In 1992 he published [HTML Tags](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html) which outlines the 18 tags that made up the language at the time.
