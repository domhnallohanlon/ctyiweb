### Overview
There are lots of different ways to prepresnet colour in code. A widely used standard is rgb, 
or rgba if you want to create components that are transparent or semi-transparent. 

### Red, Green and Blue
You may already know from physics that the primary colours of light are red, green and blue. 
Mixing all three will produce white light and the absence of any colour appears as black 
to our eyes. The amounts of red, green and blue are each specified by a number between 0 
and 255. For example red could be represented by (255, 0, 0) or one shade of grey might be 
(125, 125, 125)

### Alpha Channel
Most modern browsers will also support a fourth parameter, known as an alpha value or 
opacity value - opacity is just the opposite of transparency. You can set the alpha value anywhere 
between 0 (for full transparnecy) and 1 (for full opacity).

### How many colours?
All in all there are over 16 million different colours that can be defined using RGB notation,
256 x 256 x 256 = 16, 777, 216.
