###Syntax
When writing CSS you can style, for example all the H1 elements on a page. To do this you just write the tag name and create a set of braces. In between the curly braces you specify the property you want to change, and the value you want to give it in the format **property: value;** see below of a real example.

    h1{
     background-color: #ff0000;
     color: #00ff00;
     font-family: sans;
    }
