### Overview
Despite all your best efforts, and even with the help of code completion and syntax highlighting from your favourite text editor, it is still possible to make mistakes with your code. Thankfully there are a number of services available to check (or validate!) your HTML code.

### W3C
The World Wide Web Consortium, often referred to by the abberviation W3C, provides a service to validate any HTML pages that you write. 
You can either check the code as hosted on a server by specifying the URL or upload your HTML file [directly here][https://http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload+with_options]

### !DOCTYPE
Don't forget the DOCTYPE tag.
