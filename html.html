          <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. This means that all the content - such as text, images, 
          tables etc. - is marked up so that a web browser can understand what it is. You mark up content but 
          putting tags around it. A tag is anything contained between brackets like these: <br>
          <code> &lt; &nbsp; &gt; </code> <br>
          Usually you have to put an opening tag before the content and a closing tag
          after it. For example, to begin a HTML document you need an opening HTML tag that looks like this: <br>
          <code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code> <br>
          The corresponding closing tag is very similar, it just has an additional <code> / </code> like so: <br>
          <code> &lt;/HTML&gt; </code>
          
          </p>
